This is a github repo for my Reinforcement Learning research that is still in progress.

Do note that this repo remains under development hence there are still bugs!

things to take note:
rollout = action, step, MDP, it can be indexed
its possible to reverse the action performed during transform using inverse
PPO needs sufficient samples to be stable and GAE requires trajectories rather than individual episodes
double check the implementation for discrete distributions for actor
